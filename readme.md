# Diablo II: Resurrected - Offline Patcher

A simple tool that remaps & bypasses *Diablo II Resurected* module and then continues to patch connection functions to allow local gameplay. 

More information about the crc32 bypassing and remaping can be found in my '[Bypassing World of Warcraft's Read-Only Code Protection (crc32)](https://ferib.dev/blog.php?l=post/Bypassing_World_of_Warcraft_Crc32_Integrity_Checks)' blog post
